# Management of Published Assets {#PublishedAssetsManagement}

Described below is how to manage assets published on Discover. 

Select the project from the project list and move on to the project management screen. Select Published Assets in the project menu, and a list of assets published on Discover will appear. 
The following are the items contained in the asset list. 

| Item | Description |
| --- | ---|
| Published Asset  | Name of published asset. In the case of a private node, shown as follows: `<asset name> (package name@package version)` |
| Type  | Type of asset. Either Flow, InfoType or Private Node. |
| Publisher  | Username of user who published. |
| Status  | Status of published asset. The details are described below. |
| Downloads  | Number of times the asset was imported to projects. |
| Last Published  | Time when the asset was published or the status was changed |
| ・・・ | When you click on it, a submenu will appear. If you click on Unpublish in the submenu, the asset will be deleted from Discover. In the case of private nodes, the asset will not be deleted immediately due to necessary procedures required for canceling of the agreement entered into at the time of import. Uhuru will contact the user to take care of the process. |
