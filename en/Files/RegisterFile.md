For details on the settings aside from that above such as the deploy directory, deploy time execution and hooks, refer to [File Settings](FileSettings.md).

Once the settings are done, click the ** Upload ** button to upload the file.

When the upload completes, the file is registered as an asset and the file's ** Overview ** is displayed.
