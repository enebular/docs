# Registering Files {#Registering Files}

In order to deploy a file to a device, it first must be registered as an asset on enebular. The following explains how to go about that registration.

First, select **Files** from the project menu to display the registered file asset list.

Click the **+** button at the bottom right of the file list.

The **Add File** popup will be displayed. Here, first select the file to register.

Select the file by either dragging and dropping it onto the dotting lines area or clicking **select it**.
Also set the following required item.

| Item | Description | Content to Specify |
| --- | --- |
| Name | File asset name | A descriptive name of your choosing |

For details on the settings aside from that above such as the deploy directory and deploy time execution, refer to [File Settings](FileSettings.md).

After selecting the file and setting the required item, click the ** Upload ** button at the bottom of the popup to upload the file.

When the upload completes, the file is registered as an asset and the file's ** Overview ** is displayed.

From the ** Overview ** it's possible to deploy the flow and change its settings.

For details on deploying files, refer to [Deploying Files](DeployFile.md).
