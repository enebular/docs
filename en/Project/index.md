# Projects {#Projects}

A **Project** is, as the name suggests, the unit for organizing a set of work as a single project.

As mentioned in the [Introduction](../INDEX.md), you can manage assets and devices in a project (in the image, devices are not included within the project as their actual deploy location is in a third party service environment).

The list of projects can be seen on the screen after signing in. Projects can be created with **Create Project**.

Selecting a project will take you to the project management screen.

The project management screen includes the following pages.

## Assets {#Assets}

### Assets Searching {#Assets Searching}

You can search the Assets associated with your account by using the search box at the the top of the page.

You are able to search by Asset name or Project name. 
Searching by Project name will list all Project's Assets.
