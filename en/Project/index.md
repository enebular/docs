# Projects

A **Project** is, as the name suggests, the unit for organizing a set of work as a single project.

As mentioned in the [Introduction](../INDEX.md), you can manage assets and devices in a project (in the image, devices are not included within the project as their actual deploy location is in a third party service environment).

The list of projects can be seen on the screen after signing in. Projects can be created with **Create Project**.
