Devices can be searched by selecting **Search**.

The **Search** modal, provides the following filters to select from:

Combining multiple filters is possible.

**Warning: Deploy Status is only supported for deployments to enebular-runtime-agent version 2.5.0 and above.**

## Saving Filters

Clicking on **Search** in the Search modal after you have selected your filters will show the filtered results.

Above the search results, you can see the filter you added.

For example:

```

```

Select **Save Filter** and give it a name to _save_ it.

Saved filters can be accessed in **Select Filter** from the Device List.

## Managing Filters

From **Select Filter**, **Manage Filters** can be accessed.
