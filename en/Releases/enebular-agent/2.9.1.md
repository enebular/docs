## Fixed {#Fixed}

- Fixed the problem which caused enebular editor's remote mode to fail when a flow which invokes an external process or contains large amount of nodes is loaded.
- Improvements have been made so that retry is made when an installation failure or an update failure is caused by communication troubles.

## Changed {#Changed}

- The level of privileges which is required for enebular-agent's installation to AWS IoT as been lowered for the better security. IAMFullAccess is no longer necessary. It now only requires AWSIoTConfigAccess. Please refer to [Installation](https://docs.enebular.com/en/enebularagent/installation) for details.
