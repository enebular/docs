\* The nodes with "Additional functions" are "✓" are the nodes that had additional functions when Node-RED is updated to 1.0. Therefore, it may not work properly with enebular-agent 2.14.1 and earlier. The enebular-agent must be updated to 2.15.0 or later to use these added functions.
\* The nodes with "enebular-agent 2.15.0 and Later" are "Excluded" are the nodes which are excluded from the nodes to be installed by default since the release of enebular-agent 2.15.0.
