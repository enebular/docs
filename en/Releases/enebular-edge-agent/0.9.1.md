## Changed
* Changed to conceal Wi-Fi password on MicroSD.
    * Rewriting the password on MicroSD to default value after it's saved on flash memory.
* Flows with setting values less than 1 second are set to 1 second.
* For Digital Out nodes, added available data types of msg properties.
    * string(`true` / `false`)
    * bool(`true` / `false`) **new**
    * number(`1` /  `0`) **new**
* When flow is deployed device is rebooted to ensure execution of flow.

## Known Issues

* When using a BME280 node, it may not operate correctly if the flow size is large.
* An Inject node can set only a Timestamp for the Payload and Repetition of the Interval.
* Excessive deployment within a span of one minute may cause failure of flow initialization.
    * The device will stop in case of a flow initialization failure. To resolve this, reboot the device by pressing the reset button.
