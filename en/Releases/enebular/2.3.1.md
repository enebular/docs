# 2.3.1 (July 11th, 2018)

## New

None

## Fixed

- Fixed an issue which has been causing the twitter node on the flow editor to fail.

## Changed

- The Raspberry_Pi node of the flow editor has been made available.

## Known Issues

* Opening the flow editor from a web browser shows Japanese texts even if the browser is configured to show English.
* InfoMotion-embedded pages fail to show graphs when the browser which opens them is not logged into enebular.
* The current flow editor allows multiple users to open the same flow simultaneously; however, if each clicks on "Deploy" button, only the last saved flow will remain on enebular.

â€»Some content was corrected because there was omission in the release notes.
