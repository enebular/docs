## Fixed {#Fixed}

N/A

## Changed {#Changed}

- Node.js is updated to Version 12.18.1.
- Node-RED is updated to Version 1.0.5.
- We have revised the nodes to be installed by default. In order to deploy these newly-added default nodes of enebular 2.25.0, the target enebular-agent must be 2.15.0 or later. Please refer to ["the Comparison Chart: Prior vs Updated Nodes"](#Chart) for the details.
    - When deploying a flow which contains the nodes excluded from the default in enebular 2.25.0 to enebular-agent v2.15.0, edit and save the flow before deploying.
    - A flow created with enebular 2.25.0 or later cannot be deployed to a heroku app created with enebular v2.24.4 and eariler. It must be deployed either as a new heroku app, or delete the existing heroku app, and then deploy as the new heroku app with the same name.

\* The nodes with "Additional functions" are "✓" are the nodes that had additional functions when Node-RED is updated to 1.0. Therefore, it may not work properly with enebular-agent 2.14.1 and earlier. The enebular-agent must be updated to 2.15.0 or later to use these added functions.
\* The nodes with "enebular 2.25.0 and Later" are "Excluded" are the nodes which are excluded from the nodes to be installed by default since the release of enebular 2.25.0. 

## Known Issues {#KnownIssues}

- The Filter function cannot be used on shared pages with InfoMotion embedded.
- Clicking on the enebular logo from the "Contact" page causes the top page to be shown in the web browser's default language instead of the original "Contact" page language.
