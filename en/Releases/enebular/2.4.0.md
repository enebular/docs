## Known Issues

* Opening the flow editor from a web browser shows Japanese texts even if the browser is configured to show English.
* InfoMotion-embedded pages fail to show graphs when the browser which opens them is not logged into enebular.
* The current flow editor allows multiple users to open the same flow simultaneously; however, if each clicks on "Deploy" button, only the last saved flow will remain on enebular.
