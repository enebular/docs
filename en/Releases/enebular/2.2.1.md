# 2.2.1 (June 4th, 2018)

## New

None

## Fixed

- Fixed the issue that allowed a user to modify one's privileges on a project which one had already given away its ownership.
- Fixed an issue that allowed the users to edit graphs in Live mode on InfoMotion.
- Fixed an issue that caused InfoMotion to leak memory when removing graphs in Live mode.
- Fixed an issue that caused InfoMotion to close the property settings screen during user's attempt to change settings.
- The (+) button to add graphs on InfoMotion has been slightly enlarged for the better usability.

## Known Issues

* Opening the flow editor from a web browser shows Japanese texts even if the browser is configured to show English.
* InfoMotion-embedded pages fail to show graphs when the browser which opens them is not logged into enebular.
* The current flow editor allows multiple users to open the same flow simultaneously; however, if each clicks on "Deploy" button, only the last saved flow will remain on enebular.
