###Create a Data Source 

In the same enebular project click `Data Source` and the plus button to add a 
`Data Source`.

Set the `title` as you like. The `app_id` and `DataStore` are required fields. 
In this case we can leave `API Key` and `Secret Key` empty. 
The `DataStore` should be set to "test" and `App Id` from your milkcocoa app. 
Click save to continue.
