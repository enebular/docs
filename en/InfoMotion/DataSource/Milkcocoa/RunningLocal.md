For milkcocoa to be used locally it must be 
served from a http server. 

For node.js users we recommend you use a simple npm module [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) to serve your index.html locally. 

Or simply use 
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in the terminal at your root directory to run the index.html.
For information on pythons SimpleHTTPServer see 
https://docs.python.org/2/library/simplehttpserver.html.
