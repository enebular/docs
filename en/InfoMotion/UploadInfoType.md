# Uploading InfoType to enebular

Once the InfoType has been packaged [see InfoMotion tool](./InfoMotionTool.md)
The InfoType is ready to be uploaded.

In enebular select `InfoType` and click on `upload`

You can choose to select or drag and drop `plugin.js`, `plugin.css` and `plugin.json`.

Once the files have been successfully uploaded
a preview of the InfoMotion will be displayed along with the
`sampleData` and `sampleSettings` from the plugin.json.

Now the Infomotion is loaded to Enebular let's see how we can
connect it to a [DataSource](./CreateDataSource.md) and view/edit it in [Dashboard](./CreateInfoMotion.md).
