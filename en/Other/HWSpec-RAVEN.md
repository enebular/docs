### Notes on the Ports{#NotesOnThePorts}
* I/O connectors can be configured to assign different functions by flow settings, and therefore these are defined as "Ports" in this documentation.  
* The Ports operate at 3.3V. Sensors/actuators which are specifically designed for 5V operation are not compatible with this unit.
* The Ports are not designed to be disconnected while in operation(they do not support "hot swapping"). Please remember to turn the power off before connecting to or disconnecting sensors/actuators from the Ports.
* The maximum current for each Port is rated at 50mA(the total current of 4 Ports at 200mA). Please pay attention not to exceed these limitations.  
* Do not feed power into the power terminals of the Ports. Such an action can cause damages on the unit.
* The power supply of sensors/actuators cannot be controlled from Flows (RAVEN constantly supplies power to these Ports).
* Signal pins(SIG1/2) on the Ports 1-4 are connected through the protective registers (33ohms).
  When a Port is active, its function, I/O and its pull up/down state are defined within the flow.
  At the power-on state(before flows are read into internal firmware), all Ports are disabled.
    * PORT3/4
        * When these ports are disabled, they are configured as input ports and are pulled-down by MCU approximatelly at 40 kilo-ohms.
    * PORT1/2
        * When these ports are disabled, they are configured as input ports and are pulled-up by MCU approximatelly at 4.7 kilo-ohms.
        * When these ports operate as I2C or SDL/SDA lines are pulled-up at 4.7 kilo-ohms.

* There are limitations to the functions each Port can be configured to.

Please refer to the diagram for the details.  
NOTE: The diagram mentions PWM(TMR) and UART, however these features have yet been implemented.

### Notes on the Internal function block{#NotesOnTheInternalFunctionBlock}
* SPIFlash, WLAN module, MbedI/F(DAPLink), the Ports, the user switch, and the user LED are connected around main MCU(STM32F767).
* The SPIFlash is reserved by the system and currently cannot be accessed from flows.

### Notes on the Internal Power block{#NotesOnTheInternalPowerBlock}
* The input voltage which is fed through the microUSB connector is conveted into 3.3V by the Buck-Boost regulator, then supplied to internal circuitry and Ports.
* The internal power block is protected by a Poly Switch directly next to the USB line and the built-in protection of the Buck-Boost regulator.
