# Flows

Flows are a feature of enebular where you use the flow editor based on the <a href="https://nodered.jp/" target="_blank">Node-RED</a> tool (which is designed to connect hardware, APIs and online services) to process data.

Note that as shown in the image below, while it is possible to deploy flows within Node-RED, here the purpose of this is to just save the flow, and when doing this **the flow execution will stop after a few minutes**.

To have the data flow run for an extended period of time, it must be [deployed to another service](../Deploy/index.md).

[Created flows](./CreateFlow.md) can be checked on enebular.

Selecting a flow will take you to the flow details screen.

## Overview

You can edit the flow information and publish flows from the overview. The flow information is useful as an aid for users to understand what kind of flow it is once it has been published, so we recommend providing as much information as possible.
