# An Important Notice

If you are using Heroku Deploy, it may become necessary to recreate Heroku applications in some cases. 

mLab MongoDB Add-on, which is being used in Heroku applications created in enebular, will be [unavailable](https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/1823) for use as of November 10, 2020. Heroku applications described below must be recreated by November 9, 2020.

Heroku applications created using Heroku Deploy before September 8, 2020.

Heroku applications created using Heroku Deploy on September 8, 2020 or after, do not use Heroku mLab MongoDB Add-on, and therefore do not need to be recreated.

Please refer to the [document](../Deploy/DeployFlow/Heroku/recreating-by-postgres-addon.md) for details about recreation. 

## Precaution for Recreating Heroku Applications 

- Users are to perform recreation on his or her own. 
- In case necessary recreation is not completed, the Heroku application
 will not operate correctly.
